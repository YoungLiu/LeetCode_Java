//Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
//
//        For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100),
//        return 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000).
//
//        Follow up:
//        If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
